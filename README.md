# CyberWatchDoug
Engineer by mind and of heart. I consider my work to be at the crossroads of infrastructure, security, and DevOps.

In the mind of an engineer working in IT, every error is a puzzle waiting to teach something new. 

What others see as failure, I see as feedback. Itâ€™s not just about solving the problem. Itâ€™s about becoming better with every line of code that didnâ€™t work the first time.

I also run a blog at [https://blog.cyberwatchdoug.com](https://blog.cyberwatchdoug.com)

## Projects

**homelab_ansible**

  a collection of Ansible playbooks and scripts designed to automate the setup, configuration, backup, and management of services in a personal homelab environment. It includes automation for user bootstrapping, lightweight Kubernetes (k3s) deployment, Paperless-NGX backup routines, and secure credential management using Ansible Vault, with a focus on Fedora Linux and OpenMediaVault systems.
