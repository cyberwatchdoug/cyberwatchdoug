# CyberWatchDoug
ðŸ“Ž A Portfolio of Projects and Tinkerings

My passion is in cybersecurity and information assurance and security. However, my projects and tinkerings encompass the broader information security (IT) world.

## Projects

**homelab_ansible**

  a collection of Ansible playbooks and scripts designed to automate the setup, configuration, backup, and management of services in a personal homelab environment. It includes automation for user bootstrapping, lightweight Kubernetes (k3s) deployment, Paperless-NGX backup routines, and secure credential management using Ansible Vault, with a focus on Fedora Linux and OpenMediaVault systems.
