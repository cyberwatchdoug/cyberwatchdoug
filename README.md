# CyberWatchDoug
Engineer by mind and of heart. I consider my work to be at the crossroads of infrastructure, security, and DevOps.

In the mind of an engineer working in IT, every error is a puzzle waiting to teach something new. 

What others see as failure, I see as feedback. Itâ€™s not just about solving the problem. Itâ€™s about becoming better with every line of code that didnâ€™t work the first time.

I also run a blog at [https://blog.cyberwatchdoug.com](https://blog.cyberwatchdoug.com)

## Homelab

Everything starts and stops with my homelab. It's where I get to break, fix, and rebuild in a continuous cycle to learn and harnes my craft of working in IT engineering.

### Version 1

My original homelab was designed for resilience, automation, and security-first networking.

- The backbone features on OPNsense firewall running on a Protectli Vault Pro.
- Proxmox running on a Dell Optiplex 3080 (i5-10500T, 16GB RAM, dual NICs)
  - I added an additional NIC for my management VLAN
  - This runs VMs and LXCs
- Proxmox running on my old custom PC (will add stats soon)
  - Multiple NICs for management VLAN
  - Runs VMs and LXCs

Main services in my homelab include:
- Omada SDN, running in Podman on a Fedora VM. Provides centralized management for VLANs and my wireless network.
  - Tied into my TP-Link TL-SG2008 V3, and TP-Link AX5400 AP
- Pihole, running in Debian-based LXC
- Docmost, running in Debian-based LXC
- Caddy, running in Debian-based LXC (my reverse proxy for accessing services/apps)
- Proxmox Backup Server (PBS) running as a VM inside Proxmox, with a dedicated passthrough hard drive.
- OpenMediaVault (OMV) running as a VM inside Proxmox, with a dedicated passthrough hard drive
- Ansible, running from Fedora VM to manage various configurations.

Network Segmentation
- I primarily use VLANs to segment out my network
  - Management VLAN
  - IoT VLAN
  - Work VLAN
  - Default VLAN

## Projects

**homelab_ansible**

  a collection of Ansible playbooks and scripts designed to automate the setup, configuration, backup, and management of services in a personal homelab environment. It includes automation for user bootstrapping, lightweight Kubernetes (k3s) deployment, Paperless-NGX backup routines, and secure credential management using Ansible Vault, with a focus on Fedora Linux and OpenMediaVault systems.
